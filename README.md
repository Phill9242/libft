# Libft

This is the very first project at the **Ã©cole 42**.

The main objective in this project it's introduce the basics of library in C, Makefile, pointers, memory allocation and the purpose of basic functions in C.
Also, as most of 42 students, I didn't have a solid background in any language, so this project help me to understand better the concepts of loops, variables, if/else, returns and algorithms.

To achieve this objective we must build our own library that mimics the behaviour of many C functions (such as calloc, atoi, strjoin, etc.) and create some new functions to help us along the course.

It's forbidden to use any C function (with the exception of Malloc and Write).

We have to write all functions in accord to the **norm** (a intern regulation at 42 that help us to be more familiar with padronization and standards at the tech environment).


## Bonus part

The bonus part of this project introduce us to the concept of lists and linked lists in C.

We must develop a struct as a list and some functions that help us to manipulated such lists.
